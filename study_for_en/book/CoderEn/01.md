When Apple launched the iPhone through an exclusive partnership with AT&T in 2007, seventeen-year-old George Hotz wanted
to use an iPhone but not with AT&T. He wanted to make calls through his own T-Mobile network, so he cracked AT&T's lock
on the iPhone. Apple scrambled to fix the bug that allowed this, but officially ignored George Hotz.
