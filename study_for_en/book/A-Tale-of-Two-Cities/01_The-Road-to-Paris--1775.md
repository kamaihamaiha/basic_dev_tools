## 01 The road to Paris- 1775

It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.
It was the season of lights, It was the season of darkness.
It was the spring of hope, It was the winter of sadness.
It was the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.

In France there was a King and a Queue, and in England there was a King and a Queue. They believed that noting would ever change.

But in France things were bad, and getting worse.

The people were poor, hungry and unhappy.

The King made paper money and spent it, and the people had noting to eat.

Behind closed doors in the homes of the people, voices spoke in whispers against the King and his noblemen.

They were only whispers, but the were the angry whispers of desperate people.

Late on November night, in that same year 1775, a coach going from London to Dover, stopped at the top of a long hill.

The houses were tired, but as they rested, the driver heard an other horse coming up fast up the hill behind them.

The rider stopped his horse beside the coach and shouted: "I want a passenger, Mr Jarvis Lorry," said one of the passengers, putting his head out of he window.

"What do you want?"

"It's me! Jerry, Jerry Cruncher, from Tellson's Bank, sir," cried the man on the horse.

"What's the matter, Jerry?" called Mr Lorry.

"A message for you, Mr Lorry. You've got to wait at Dover for a yong lady."
