## Same and Different

Mrs. Kumar likes to shop for her twins. Today she's looking at sweaters.
There are many different colors on sale. Mrs. Kumar chooses two matching
green sweaters.

The next day, Manda and Anya open their gifts. Manda likes the green sweater,
but Anya is disappointed. Mrs. Kumar understands the problem. Anya wants to 
be different.

Manda keeps her sweater, but Anya goes to the store. She exchanges her green
sweater for a navy blue sweater. It's an easy answer to Anya's problem. Now
the twins can be warm, happy and different.
